%% Text of abstract
The Permanent Oscillatory Cosmology is confirmed by 71 formula giving the Hubble radius, with 7 correlating to $10^{-9}$. The computer shows that the best formula are obtained using the Atiyah constant and the number 137, the Eddington's integer part of the electric constant. This is conforms with Atiyah's testimony about the Physics-Mathematics unification and the central role of arithmetics in the unification process of both mathematics and physics. The identification with the Eddington statistical formula gives $G$, compatible with the $10^{-5}$ precise BIPM measurement and the $10^{-6}$ precise quasar non-Doppler Kotov period. The hypothesis of a computing Cosmos implies a $\pi$ rationalization process which validates the Wyler's theory and the Fermion Koide formula in the $10^{-9}$ domain.

\section{Introduction}
  
    From Hirzebruch's work \cite{Hirzebruch}, which revolutionized geometry and topology, Sir Michael Atiyah, Raoul Bott \cite{Bott} and Isadore Singer \cite{Singer} introduced the index theory, acclaimed by theoretical physicists \cite{Alvarez}. Following this path, on the advice of the physicist Gerard t'Hooft, Atiyah looked for the determination of the electrical constant $a \approx 137.035999085(21)$ \cite{Atiyah}.
    
    
    At the 2018 Heidelbergh Laureate Forum, he showed that the extrapolation of the Euler formula  $e^{2i\pi} = 1$ to the quaternions leads to the 'Atiyah constant' $\Gamma = \gamma a/\pi $. Meanwhile, he rehabilitated the Eddington \cite{Eddington} bare electrical constant, the prime number 137, and announced that the resolution of the Riemann conjecture appears as a "bonus". Moreover, the four forces would be connected to the four principal algebra, whose the octonion non-associative one would be tied to the gravitation constant $G$ in a future work \cite{Atiyah}.

\section{The scope and method}
   Quite independently, the $G$ value was tied to the invariant Hubble radius $R$ in the \textit {Coherent Cosmology}. A computer analysis has shown that it is confirmed in the ppb domain ($10^{-9}$) by simple formula involving the Atiyah constant \cite{Sanchez}. The aim of this article is to confirm the unificaton process, both in mathematics and physics, according to the \textit {arithmetic} approach of Eddington, Hirzebruch and Atiyah.
   
   Our main hypothesis is that \textit{both} mathematics and physics standard model are incomplete, and that the so far unexplained measured adimensional constants (see Table 1) can be used as a guide for the overall arithmetics unification. Recall that the search for correlations between the measurements is the heart of the scientific method, as the history shows, through Dalton, Proust, Balmer, Mendeleiv, Mandel... In particular, the Atiyah constant  enters the core of Coherent Cosmology, the Topological Axis (Fig. 1), both in connection with the Higgs boson and the galaxy group radius, a crucial cosmic distance.
   
   
   In conformity with the Atiyah's physics-mathematics unification idea, this table 1 mixes physical adimensional constants \cite{Tanabashi} with pure mathematics constants. But among the later an important distinction is made. Only the whole nubers are considered as exact. For instance the Archimedes constant $\pi$ is refered only as 'exact', meaning one can uses it in a computer calculation, only if one defines an imprecision domain. From this argument, the Cosmos vastness has been justified by  quasi-continuous quantum holography, where the whole large numbers of Lucas-Mersenne \cite{Bastin} and Eddington \cite{Eddington} are central \cite{Sanchez}.  
      
   In particular, the fact that the Muon-Electrion mass ratio is measured to 10 ppb, while nobody knows the role of Muon in Nature, is very intriguing. We show here that this permits to definitely validate the empiric Koide formula, connected with a rehabilitation of Wyler's theory through, precisely,a $\pi$ rationalisation process. 
   
   While the Atiyah's work does not seem to give the $a$ value, nor the Riemann conjecture solution, he suggested \textit{there is a bridge between the octonion algebra and the sporadic groups} \cite{Atiyah1}. Now, the Topological Axis shows clearly the height-fold Bott periodicity, typical of octonion algebra, which is also present in the Periodic Table, and analysis has shown the central role of the Monster group order in Coherent Cosmology \cite{Sanchez}. This article will confirm this Atiyah's prediction, unifying two appently no-connected mathematical domains. Note that the sporadic domain has already been connected with the modular function \cite{Conway} \cite{Borcherds}. This will be central in this study.
       
     Moreover, the present article confirms that the totality of the 26 sporadic groups are involved, as well as, most unexpectedly, the \textit{multi-dimensional crystallography}. 


\section{The rehabilitation of 137 from the electroweak coupling constant}

 This was very surprising because the Eddington theory, accused of pythagorism, was rejected. But he also predicted the importance of the $N_16 = 136$ elements of a symmetrical matrix 16 x 16, giving 137 by adding unity, whose pertinence is confirmed by the very precisely (0.1 ppm) measured electroweak coupling (inverse) factor 

\begin{equation}
a_w = (2\times137 \Gamma)^3
\end{equation}
 
Atiyah presented this number by the form $137 = 2^0 + 2^3 + 2^7$. Moreover, this additive unity is clearly tied to the Combinatorial Hierarchy \cite{Bastin}, based on the Catalan-Mersenne series starting with 3, because $N_4 = 10 = 3 + 7 and 3+7 + 127 = 137 = N_{16} + 1$. The following term $N_{32}  = 528$ cannot be compared with the enormous Lucas-Mersenne Large Number $2^{127}- 1$, so it is the last term of the Hierarchy. 

This Lucas number appears in the precise (ppb) formula of table 3, in liaison with 137. Moreover $32^2 - N_{32} =  496$ is the above dimension of the superstring gauge group SO(32), and \textit {the third perfect number}, see below the importance of this fact, not reckognized untill now.


\section{The Planck law connection with the Bernouilli function}

 Moreover, $a$ is tied in the superstring 9D space with the two constants of the Planck law, whose kernel is the Bernouilli fonction, $x/(1-e^{-x})$, \textit {central in the Atiyah's work} [2]. These are the reduced Wien displacement constant $w$, and the number of photons $16\pi \zeta(3)$ in a volume $\lambda^3$, with $\lambda = hc/kT $, corresponding to one photon by volume $l_{ph}^3$:

\begin{equation}
(16\pi\zeta(3))^3/w^4 = \lambda^5l_{Wien}^4/l_{ph}^9 \approx \pi_a^3a    \Rightarrow     \pi_a: 3;7;16;17p_an/p
\end{equation}

As in the preceeding case, this is a symbolic rationalisation. This is the single formula obtained by computer in this article.

\section{Conclusion}

This work proves the existence of an Ultimate Massive String Theory, and, according to the Atiyah's testimony [3], that the octonion algebra and the sporadic groups are related, opening a new field in mathematical research. In the scope of a computational Cosmos, the main parameters appears as calculation bases, and he Wyler's theory is completely rehabilitated  The most imminent prediction is that the James Webb telescope will show old galaxies in the far field, instead of the predicted so-called ``dark age''.
